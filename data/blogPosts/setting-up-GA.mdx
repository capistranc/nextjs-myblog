- [Adding Meta Tags](#add-meta-tags)

- [Google Search Console](#google-search-console)

- [Adding a sitemap](#add-sitemap)

- [Google Tags](#google-tags)

## Set Up

So to begin create a new google analytics account for the website. It is going to ask you for an
account name and a property name.
I use:

Account Name: ${Name of Website} Property Name: Basic.

Once you've created your google analytics account and insert the url of your website you should arrive at a page that has
a stream URL and a MeasurementID

GA-Measurement ID looks something like this G-FHQWHGADS123

Copy the Measurement ID because we are going to need it to hook into our Website.

## Hook GA into NextJS

Google provides you with the code to insert into your website. If you are creating your website with vanilla
HTML and JS you would just stick this script at the top of your Headers.

If you are using NextJS you are going to want to stick this at the top of your headers in your \_document file.

This insures that GA is hooked up to every page in NextJS, before the NextJS \_app even renders.

```javascript:gtag.js
<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-FHQWHGADS123"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'G-H6QG2RFBMD');
</script>

```

If you are using our Web-Skeleton Boilerplate we already have this tag injected into the top of the \_\_document.tsx
All you have to do is add into your local.env like so:

```
GA_ID='G-FHQWHGADS123'
```

## Google Search Console

## Adding a sitemap

## Google Tags

What's the difference between google tags and Google Analytics? Well Google Analytics
is a type of tag, one of many. And Google Tags is a Tag Manager, used for managing
many different metrics. Google Analytics 4 is one such bundle of metrics.
